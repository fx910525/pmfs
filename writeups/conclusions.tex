\section{Summary and Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In Paper I of this series, we proposed a new method to detect extremely weak magnetic fields in the IGM during the Dark Ages, using 21--cm tomography. In this paper, Paper II, we forecast the sensitivity of this method with data from future 21--cm tomography surveys. For this purpose, we developed a minimum--variance estimator for the magnetic field, that can be applied to the measurements of the 21--cm brightness temperature prior to the epoch of reionization. 

The main results are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:xi_vs_deltas} and \ref{fig:B_vs_deltas}. Their implication is that a radio array in a compact--grid configuration with a collecting area slightly larger than one square kilometer can achieve $1\sigma$ sensitivity to a uniform magnetic field of strength $\sim10^{-21}$ Gauss comoving. The case of a stochastic field is more challenging (by a factor of a few in the case of a field with a scale--invariant power spectrum), and measuring the spectral shape of such field would require even larger array baselines to achieve.

The prospect for measuring the magnetic fields at high redshift using this method depends on the rate of depolarization of the ground state of hydrogen through Lyman--$\alpha$ pumping, which is proportional to the Lyman--$\alpha$ flux at high redshift. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Bsat}, most of the sensitivity to magnetic fields comes from $z\sim 21$, where the Lyman--$\alpha$ flux sufficiently decreases, while the kinetic temperature of the IGM is still low enough. However, the value of the Lyman--$\alpha$ flux at these redshifts is completely unconstrained by observation. While the fiducial model we used in our calculations represents one that saticefies modeling constraints and can be extrapolated to match low--redshift observations, it does not capture the full range of possibilities. It is thus important to keep in mind that the projected sensitivity can vary depending on this quantity. We qualitatively capture the variation in projected sensitivity by exploring Lyman--$\alpha$ flux models that stay within a factor of a few from the fiducial model, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmo}.

In our analysis, we took into account the noise component arising from Galactic synchrotron emission, but we ignored more subtle effects (such as the frequency dependence of the beams, etc.) which may further complicate reconstruction of the magnetic--field signal and should be taken into account in a detailed analyses and figures of merit for future experiments.
Finally, we note that the effect of cosmic shear on the 21--cm signal (from weak lensing of the signal by the intervening large scale structure) can produce a noise bias for the magnetic--field measurements. In Appendix \ref{app:lensing}, we examine the level of lensing contamination and show that it is negligible for most array sizes considered in this work. 

An array of about a kilometer squared of collecting area corresponds to the plans for the next stages of some of the current reionization--epoch experiments (in terms of the number of antennas, compare to HERA and to the SKA \cite{2008arXiv0802.1727C}, for example). The number of mode measurements required for placing a meaningful upper limit on the early--time magnetic fields considered in this work does not supersede computational demands for the next--generation  experiments, and is thus achievable in the coming future. It is worth emphasizing again that the main limitation to our method is the fact that it relies on the effects that require two--scattering processes. As soon as the quality of the 21--cm statistics reaches the level necessary to probe second--order processes, the effect of magnetic precession we discussed in this series of papers will lend unprecedented precision to a new \textit{in situ} probe of minuscule, possibly primordial, magnetic fields at high redshift.

We now proceede to numerically evaluate the sensitivity of a tomographic 21-cm survey to detecting magnetic fields during the pre-reionization epoch, using the formalism of previous two Sections. For the purposes of deriving numerical results, we only focus on one type of experimental setup---an array of closely-packed dipole antennas, such as the FFTT considered in \S\ref{subsec:uv}. The motivation for this choice is the fact that such configuration is known to maximize sensitivity of cosmological measurements \cite{2009PhRvD..79h3530T}. We consider an array with a surface area of $(\Delta L\text{ km})^2$ covered in dipole antennas.

The computation of $t_1$ from the total duration of the survey  $t_\text{obs}$ depends on the type of the experiment.  For a beam of a solid angle $\Omega_\text{beam}=\lambda^2/A_e$ much smaller than the solid angle $\Omega_\text{survey}$ of the entire survey, where telescopes scan the sky one beamwidth at a time (such as the case for radio dishes), $t_1$ is the total time spent observing one $(u,v)$ element of size corresponding to the beam size, $t_1=t_\text{obs}\Omega_\text{survey}/\Omega_\text{beam}$. However, in the case of an array of dipoles, the beam is greater or equal to the survey angular size, and $t_1=t_\text{obs}$. When deriving numerical results, we assume the latter. Also, we do not account for the fact that a given patch of the sky is only visible for a part of a day from a given location; therefore, $t_\text{obs}$ we use in \S\ref{sec:results} will be shorter than the wall-clock time of the survey, by a factor of a few. We take $\Omega_\text{survey}=1$sr, and the wall-clock survey duration of about 2 years (corresponding to $t_1=1$ year).%\footnote{The value used to evaluate Fisher formulas is actually 2 years. When corrected for the effect of Earth's rotation, and the fact that a given sky patch is above the horizon for only a fraction of a day, the effective observation time of 2 years translates to a (factor-of-a-few) longer wall-clock time.} 
For the sky temperature that enters the calculation of the noise power spectrum in \eq{\ref{eq:Pnoise_K}}, we assume a simple model of Galactic foregrounds from \cite{2008PhRvD..78b3529M}, where
\beq
T_\text{sky}  = 60\left(\frac{21}{100} (1+z)\right)^{2.55}\text{   [K]}.
\label{eq:tsys}
\eeq
Furthermore, we assume that the redshift range covered by the survey is $z\in[15,35]$.  

Other ingredients entering the sensitivity calculation are the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux $J_{\text{Ly}\alpha}(z)$, and the spin and kinetic temperatures of the IGM; these are obtained using \texttt{21CMFAST} \cite{2011MNRAS.411..955M}, for standard cosmology, and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cosmo}. We checked that the variation in the x-ray heating rate within a factor of a few from the fiducial model does not make significant changes to the presented results.

\end{figure}
Figures \ref{fig:xi_vs_deltas} and \ref{fig:B_vs_deltas} show how the sensitivity changes as a function of the maximum baseline $\Delta L$ (since different baselines may correspond to different stages of the experiment). Figure \ref{fig:xi_vs_deltas} shows $1\sigma$ sensitivity to measuring parameter $\xi$ of \eq{\ref{eq:saturated_P}}, that distinguishes amongst the zero magnetic field case and the case where the field is strong enough that the signal saturates (in the sense described in \S\ref{sec:method}). This parameter is by definition boud between the values of 0 and 1, where 0 represents the case of no magnetic field, and 1 represents the saturated case. From this Figure, we can see that, for example, a little over a square kilometer of covarega area is necessary for a $1\sigma$ detection of magnetic fields stronger than about $10^{-21}$ Gauss comoving. While this size of a radio array is still futuristic in terms of the shear number of antennas (compare to the SKA \cite{2008arXiv0802.1727C}, for example), the number of mode measurements required for this measurement corresponds to the computational demands for the next-generation 21-cm cosmology experiment, and may thus be feasible in the coming couple of decades. 

Figure \ref{fig:B_vs_deltas} is obtained by evaluating the expressions of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:fisher_patch}) and (\ref{eq:snr_ints}), and shows sensitivity to measuring the scaled value of the magnetic field in the case of a uniform field (dark red line), and the sensitivity to measuring the amplitude of a particular model for a stochastic field (gray line)---the scale-independent (SI) power spectrum discussed in \S\ref{sec:fisher}. While the numerical calculation behind this plot assumed that the brightness temperature is a linear function of the field strength, this assumption is not guaranteed to hold---it breaks in the saturation limit, as discussed in \S\ref{sec:method}. In order to understand how the constraints (or, sensitivities) of Figure \ref{fig:B_vs_deltas} compare to the saturation ``ceiling'' at the redshifts we integrate over, we present a rough calculation of the saturation as a function of redshift, and compare it to the values of the $z$-dependent integrands of \eq{\ref{eq:fisher_patch}}. From this Figure, we can see that only above the coverage of about $16$km$^2$ are we able to actually measure the exact value of the amplitude of the magnetic field power spectrum.

When the colored curves are below the saturation limit around their minima, the analysis assuming unsaturated regime is valid.\label{fig:Bsat}}

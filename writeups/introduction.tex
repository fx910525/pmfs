\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in our universe on all observed scales \cite{2013A&ARv..21...62D,Vallee04,Neronov10,2005LNP...664...89W,2012SSRv..166..215}. However, the origins of the magnetic fields in Galaxies and on large scales is as of yet an unresolved question. Various forms of dynamo mechanisms are proposed to maintain and strengthen magnetic fields on large scales, but they typically require seed fields to act \cite{2013A&ARv..21...62D}. The seed fields may be produced in the early stages of structure formation through Biermann-battery mechanisms \cite{Naoz13,2013PhRvL.111e1303N}, or otherwise may be relics from the early universe \cite{2013A&ARv..21...62D,2012SSRv..166...37W,2014JCAP...05..040K}. Observations of weak magnetic fields in the high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) can thus may provide tools for understanding the origins of magnetic fields in the present-day universe, potentially opening up an entirely new window into the physics of the early universe.

Many observational probes have previously been used to search for evidence of large-scale magnetic fields, locally, and at high redshifts; see, e.~g.~\cite{Yamazaki10,Blasi99,Tavecchio10,Dolag11,2005LNP...664...89W,2014JCAP...01..009K,2013ApJ...770...47K,2014PhRvD..89j3522S,2006MNRAS.372.1060T,2009ApJ...692..236S}. Amongst the most sensitive tracers at high-redshifts are the measurements of the cumulative effect of Faraday rotation in the cosmic-microwave-background polarization maps, which currently place an upper limit of $\sim$$10^{-10}$ Gauss (in comoving units) using the measurements from the Planck sattelite \cite{2015arXiv150201594P}. In Paper I of this series \cite{2014arXiv1410.2250V}, we proposed a novel method to measure large-scale magnetic fields during the pre-reionization epoch (the Dark Ages). This method relies on using measurements from future 21-cm brightness-temperature tomography surveys \cite{1997ApJ...475..429M,2004PhRvL..92u1301L}, many of which have pathfinder experiments currently running \cite{2012arXiv1201.1700G,2011AAS...21813206B,2014ApJ...788..106P,2008arXiv0802.1727C,Vanderlinde14,2015AAS...22532803D}, and plans for the next stage experiments to be realized within the next decade \cite{2008arXiv0802.1727C,2015AAS...22532803D}. As we show in Paper I, the measurement of statistical anisotropy in the 21-cm signal from the Dark Ages has intrinsic sensitivity to magentic fields in the IGM more than \textit{10 orders of magnitude below the current upper limits}. 

While Paper I layed out the formalism necessary to account for the effect of  magnetic fields on the 21-cm signal, this paper (Paper II of the series) deals with evaluating the sensitivity of future experiments to making a detection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In \S\ref{sec:method}, we present a quick overview of the main results in Paper I. In \S\ref{sec:estimators}, we derive minimum-variance estimators for a uniform and a stochastic magnetic field. In \S\ref{sec:fisher}, we set up the Fisher analysis formalism necessary to evaluate detectability. In \S\ref{sec:results}, we present numerical results, and we conclude in \S\ref{sec:conclusions}. Supporting materials (derivation of the variance of visibility) are presented in appendicies.

\section{Basics}
\label{sec:basics}

Before focusing on the estimator formalism in the next Section, here we review the basics of 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation measurements. In \S\ref{subsec:def}, we setup our notation and review definitions of quantities describing sensitivity of interferometric radio arrays; in \S\ref{subsec:noise}, we focus on the derivation of the noise power spectrum; and in \S\ref{subsec:uv}, we discuss the effects of the array configuration and its relation to coverage of modes in the $uv$ plane. 

\subsection{Definitions}
\label{subsec:def}

The redshifted 21-cm signal can be represented with specific intensity at a location in physical space $I(\vec{r})$ or in Fourier space $\widetilde{I}(\vec{k})$. In sky coordinates (centered on an emitting patch of the sky), these functions become $\mathcal{I}(\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_\nu)$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{I}}(u,v,\eta)$, respectively. Here, vector $\vec{k}$ (in the units of comoving Mpc$^{-1}$) is a Fourier dual of $\vec{r}$ (comoving Mpc), and likewise, $\theta_x$ (rad), $\theta_y$ (rad), and $\theta_\nu$ (Hz) are duals of the coordinates $u$ (rad$^{-1}$), $v$ (rad$^{-1}$), and $\eta$ (seconds), respectively.  Notice that $\theta_x$ and $\theta_y$ represent the angular extent of the patch in the sky, while $\theta_\nu$ represents its extent in frequency space. The two sets of coordinates are related through linear transformations in the following way
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\theta_x = \frac{r_x}{\chi(z)}, \hspace{0.5in} u = \frac{k_x\chi(z)}{2\pi},\\
\theta_y = \frac{r_y}{\chi(z)}, \hspace{0.5in} v = \frac{k_y\chi(z)}{2\pi},\\
\theta_\nu = \frac{H(z)\nu_{21}}{c(1+z)^2} r_z, \hspace{0.5in} \eta = \frac{c(1+z)^2}{2\pi H(z)\nu_{21}}k_z,
\end{gathered}
\label{eq:fourier_duals}
\end{equation} 
where $\nu_{21}$ is the 21-cm frequency in the rest frame of emitting atoms, $H(z)$ iz the Hubble parameter, $\chi(z)$ is the comoving distance to redshift $z$, which marks the middle of the observed data cube (where $r_z$ and $\theta_\nu$ intervals are evaluated). Note that $2\pi\theta_iu = r_ik_i$, for $i\in\{x,y\}$. The convention we use for the Fourier transforms is 
\beq
\bga
I(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}\int\widetilde{I}(\vec{k})e^{i\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}}d\vec{k},\\
\widetilde{I}(\vec{k}) = \int{I}(\vec{r})e^{-i\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}}d\vec{r},
\ega
\label{eq:tildeI_I}
\eeq
where Fourier-space functions are denoted with tilde. Similarly,
\beq
\bga
\mathcal{I}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_\nu) = \int\widetilde{\mathcal{I}}(u,v,\eta)e^{2\pi i(u\theta_x + v\theta_y+\eta \theta_\nu)}dudvd\eta,\\
\widetilde{\mathcal{I}}(u,v,\eta) = \int{\mathcal{I}}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_\nu)e^{-2\pi i(u\theta_x + v\theta_y+\eta\theta_\nu)}d\theta_xd\theta_yd\theta_\nu.
\ega
\label{eq:mathcal_tildeI_I}
\eeq
From Eqs.~(\ref{eq:fourier_duals})--(\ref{eq:mathcal_tildeI_I}), we can see that the following scaling relation is saticefied
\beq
\widetilde{I}(\vec{k}) = \frac{c(1+z)^2\chi(z)^2}{H(z)\nu_{21}}\widetilde{\mathcal{I}}(u,v,\eta),
\label{eq_tilde_I_vs_Ik_scaling}
\eeq
where the proportionallity factor contains the transformation Jacobian $\frac{dr_xdr_ydr_z}{d\theta_xd\theta_yd\theta_\nu}$. Finally, the relationship between the specific intensity in the $uv$-plane and the visibility function $V(u,v,\theta_\nu)$ is given by the Fourier transform of the frequency coordinate,
\beq
\bga
 V(u,v,\theta_\nu)= \int \mathcal{\widetilde{I}}(u,v,\eta)e^{2\pi i \theta_\nu\eta}d\eta,\\
\mathcal{\widetilde{I}}(u,v,\eta) = \int V(u,v,\theta_\nu)e^{-2\pi i \theta_\nu\eta}d\theta_\nu.
\ega
\label{eq:visibility}
\eeq
Here, $\theta_{\nu,\text{max}}-\theta_{\nu,\text{min}}=\Delta\nu$ is the bandwidth of the observed data cube centered on $z$ (see also Appendix \ref{app:Vrms}).

\subsection{Power spectra and noise}
\label{subsec:noise}

In this Section, we derive the noise power spectrum for the brightness temperature signal. We start by defining a brightness-temperature power spectrum as
\beq
\langle \widetilde{I}(\vec{k})\widetilde{I}^*(\vec{k}')\rangle \equiv (2\pi)^3P_{\widetilde{I}}\delta_D(\vec{k}-\vec{k}'),
\label{eq_tildeI_power}
\eeq
where $\delta_D$ is Dirac delta function. The observable quantity of the interferometric arrays is the visibility function---a complex Gaussian variable with a zero mean and the following variance (derived in Appendix \ref{app:Vrms}) 
\beq\bga
\langle V({u},v,\theta_\nu)V({u'},v',\theta_\nu')^*\rangle \\
= \frac{1}{\Omega_\text{beam}}\left(\frac{2k_BT_\text{sky}}{A_e\sqrt{\Delta\nu t_1}}\right)^2 \delta_D({u}-{u}')\delta_D({v}-{v}')\delta_{\theta_\nu\theta_{\nu}'},
\ega
\label{eq_Vrms}
\eeq 
where $T_\text{sky}$ is the sky temperature (that in principle includes both the foreground signal from the Galaxy, and the instrument noise, where we take the latter to be subdominant in \S\ref{sec:results}); $t_1$ is the total time a single baseline observes element $(u,v)$ in the $uv$ plane; $A_e$ is the collecting area of a single dish; $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant; $\Delta\nu$ is the bandwidth of a single observation centered on $z$; and the last $\delta$ in this expression denotes the Kronecker delta.

In the next step, we to combine Eqs.~(\ref{eq:visibility}) and (\ref{eq_Vrms}), and take the ensamble average,
\beq
\bga
\langle\widetilde{\mathcal{I}}(u,v,\eta) \widetilde{\mathcal{I}}^*(u',v',\eta')\rangle \\
 = \frac{1}{t_1\Omega_\text{beam}}\left(\frac{2k_BT_\text{sky}}{A_e}\right)^2 \delta_D({u}-{u}')\delta_D({v}-{v}')\delta_D(\eta-\eta'),
\ega
\label{eq:mathcal_power_Vrms}
\eeq 
where we used
\beq
\int e^{2\pi i \theta_\nu(\eta-\eta')}d\theta_\nu =\delta_D(\eta-\eta').
\eeq
Taking into account the scaling relation of \eq{\ref{eq_tilde_I_vs_Ik_scaling}}, using \eq{\ref{eq_tildeI_power}}, and keeping in mind the scaling property of the delta function, we arrive at
\beq
P_1^N(\vec k) = \frac{c(1+z)^2\chi^2(z)}{\Omega_\text{beam}t_1H(z)\nu_{21}}\left(\frac{2k_BT_\text{sky}}{A_e}\right)^2 ,
\label{eq:Pnoise_1mode}
\eeq
for the noise power per $\vec k$ mode, per baseline.

In the last step, we wish to get from \eq{\ref{eq:Pnoise_1mode}} to the expression for the noise power spectrum that corresponds to observation with all available baselines. To do that, we need to incorporate information about the array configuration and its coverage of the $uv$ plane. In other words, we need to divide the expression in \eq{\ref{eq:Pnoise_1mode}} by the number density of baselines $n_\text{base}(\vec k)$ that observe a given mode $\vec k$ at a given time (for a discussion of the $uv$ coverage, see the following Section). The final result for the noise power spectrum per mode $\vec k$ in the intensity units is 
\beq
P^N(\vec k) = \frac{c(1+z)^2\chi^2(z)}{\Omega_\text{beam}t_1H(z)\nu_{21}}\frac{\left(2k_BT_\text{sky}\right)^2}{A_e^2n_\text{base}(\vec k)},
\label{eq:Pnoise_Jy}
\eeq
and in temperature units
\beq
P^N(\vec k) =\frac{\lambda^4c(1+z)^2\chi^2(z)}{\Omega_\text{beam}t_1H(z)\nu_{21}}\frac{T_\text{sky}^2}{A_e^2n_\text{base}(\vec k)},
\label{eq:Pnoise_K}
\eeq
where $\lambda=c/\nu_{21}(1+z)$.

\subsection{The UV coverage}
\label{subsec:uv}

Total number density $n_\text{base}(\vec k)$ of baselines that can observe mode $\vec k$ is related to the (unitless) number density $n(u,v)$ of baselines per $dudv$ element as
\beq
n_\text{base}(\vec k) = \frac{n(u,v)}{\Omega_\text{beam}},
\label{eq:nuv_nk}
\eeq
where $\frac{1}{\Omega_\text{beam}}$ represents an element in the $uv$ plane. The number density integrates to the total number of baselines $N_\text{base}$,
\beq
N_\text{base}=\frac{1}{2}N_\text{ant}(N_\text{ant}+1) = \int_\text{half} n(u,v)dudv,
\label{eq:nk}
\eeq
where $N_\text{ant}$ is the number of antennas in the array, and the integration is done on the half of the $uv$ plane (because the visibility has the following property $V(u,v,\theta_\nu)=V^*(-u,-v,\theta_\nu)$, and only half the plane contains independent samples). We assume that the array consists of many antennas, so that time-dependence of $n(u,v)$ is negligible; if this is not the case, time average of this quantity should be computed to account for Earth's rotation.

In this work, we focus on a specific array configuration that is of particualr interest to cosmology---a compact grid of dipole antennas, with a total collecting area $(\Delta L)^2$. This has been proposed for the Fast Fourier Transform Telescope (FFTT) \cite{2009PhRvD..79h3530T} and is being implemented for Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) \cite{2015AAS...22532803D}, for example. In this case, the beam solid angle is 1 sr, the affective area of a single dipole is $A_e = \lambda^2$, and the effective number of antennas is $N_\text{ant} = \frac{(\Delta L)^2}{\lambda^2}$. For such configuration, the number density of baselines entering calculation of the noise power spectrum reads
\beq
n(u,v) = (\frac{\Delta L}{\lambda} - u)(\frac{\Delta L}{\lambda} - v).
\label{eq:nuv_fftt}
\eeq
The relation between $\vec k=(k,\theta_k,\phi_k)$ and $(u,v)$ is
\beq
\bga
u_\perp \equiv \frac{\chi(z)}{2\pi}k\sin\theta_k,\\
u = u_\perp \cos\phi_k,\\
v = u_\perp \sin\phi_k,
\ega
\label{eq:k_uv}
\eeq
where subscript $\perp$ denotes components perpendicular to the line-of-sight direction ${\bf{\widehat n}}$, which, in this case, is along the $z$ axis. From this, the corresponsing number of baselines observing a given $\vec k$ is
\beq
\bga
n_\text{base}(\vec k) = (\frac{\Delta L}{\lambda} - \frac{\chi(z)}{2\pi}k\sin\theta_k\cos\phi_k)\\\times (\frac{\Delta L}{\lambda} - \frac{\chi(z)}{2\pi}k\sin\theta_k\sin\phi_k).
\ega
\label{eq:nk_fftt}
\eeq
As a last note, when computing numerical results in \S\ref{sec:results}, we substitute $\phi_k$-averaged version of this quantity (between $0$ and $\pi/2$ only, due to the four-fold symmetry of the experimental setup of a square of dipoles) when computing the noise power, in order to account for the rotation of the baselines with respect to the modes. This average number density reads
\beq
\bga
\langle n_\text{base}(\vec k) \rangle_{\phi_k}= \left(\frac{\Delta L}{\lambda}\right)^2 -\frac{4}{\pi}\frac{\Delta L}{\lambda}\frac{\chi(z)}{2\pi}k\sin\theta_k \\+ \left(\frac{\chi(z)}{2\pi}k\sin\theta_k\right)^2.
\ega
\label{eq:nk_fftt_mean}
\eeq

these steps will produce all the results in the paper:

1.  >>cd ~/Projects/Repositories/pmfs 

2.  open for editing reion_functions.py and choose (uncomment) the appropriate input file for 21cmfast stuff, lines below "# 21cmFAST inputs:" to set file_21cmfast=… to either "…midFSTAR" (default model) or "…loFSTAR" or "…hiFSTAR"

3.  make sure results has these folders: loFSTAR, hiFSTAR, midFSTAR, and that there is rns_pmfs folder

4. >>ssh minerva 
(or another linux machine)

5. >>cd ~/Projects/Repositories/pmfs 

6. 

if you want xi plot: 
>>./cluster_runner.py --mode xi --folder 'midFSTAR' 
(or another folder, depending what you want)
>>cd runs_pmfs
>>qsub go_xi_midFSTAR.sh

if you want B0 & SI plot:
>>./cluster_runner.py --mode B0 --folder 'midFSTAR' 
>>./cluster_runner.py --mode SI --folder 'midFSTAR' 
>>cd runs_pmfs
>>qsub go_B0_midFSTAR.sh
>>qsub go_SI_midFSTAR.sh

the results will be in midFSTAR (or another) folder within results

7. done!

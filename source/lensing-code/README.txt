This folder contains files and codes that are used to calculate the lensing contaminations to the magnetic field detections in our paper.

Codes are written in Python 3.5 and are compatible for Python 2.x.

Brief Introduction to Each Python file:

1. ps2.py: contains a PowerSpectrum class that will provide the linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum at given redshifts and for a given set of cosmological parameters. Halo-fit model is applied.

2. pt.py: calculates the transverse shear power spectrum P_t at redshifts z=10,20,30 and outputs them to files power_spectrum_1/2/3.dat, respectively.

3. pt_plot.py: plots the results generated by pt.py .

4. P_phi_ang.py: calculates the lensing potential power spectrum at given l (here l=6), and does the radial integral up to a list of redshifts that we are interested in. Results are output to P_phi_ang_l_6.dat .

5. covariance.py: after running P_phi_ang.py we can run this file to get the covariance matrix of the transverse shear power spectra at different redshifts, and do the de-lensing procedure using CMB lensing. The results are saved in Pt_lensing.txt (P_t before delensing), cov.dat (the full covariance matrix), and Pt_delensing.txt (P_t after delensing).

6. spurB_z_v2.py: uses the results from covariance.py and the input files: global.txt and xs_table.txt (generated from the star formation models during EoR), to calculate the lensing contaminations to magnetic field detections. It also plots the result as shown in Fig.8 in our paper.

7. neff.py: reads the input power spectrum file “matterpower.txt” and calculates the effective spectral index at given k.

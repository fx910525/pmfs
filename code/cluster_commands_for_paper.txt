These steps will produce all the results in the paper from VG IAS account, using hyperion:

1.  >>cd ~/Projects/Repositories/pmfs/code

2.  open for editing reion_functions.py and choose (uncomment) the appropriate 21cmfast input file, lines below "# 21cmFAST inputs:" to set file_21cmfast variable to either "â€¦__midFSTAR" (default model) or the other two options below it, if you are producing xi "band of uncertainty".

3.  make sure results/ has these folders: loFSTAR, hiFSTAR, midFSTAR, and that there is runs_pmfs/ folder in this location (pmfs/code/)

4. >>ssh ve 
(or another linux machine)

5. >>cd ~/Projects/Repositories/pmfs/code

6. 

if you want xi plot: 
>>./cluster_runner.py --mode xi --folder midFSTAR
(or another folder, depending what model you want)
>>cd runs_pmfs
>>qsub go_xi_midFSTAR.sh

if you want B0 & SI plot:
>>./cluster_runner.py --mode B0 --folder midFSTAR 
>>./cluster_runner.py --mode SI --folder midFSTAR 
>>cd runs_pmfs
>>qsub go_B0_midFSTAR.sh
>>qsub go_SI_midFSTAR.sh

(again, to get the ''uncertainty band'' on xi, set file_21cmfast in reion_functions.py to appropriate model and then repeat the step above for xi, for hiFSTAR or loFSTAR folder names)

the results will be in results/midFSTAR (or equivalent) folder

7. done!

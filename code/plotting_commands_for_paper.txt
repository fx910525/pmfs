This document explains how to produce all the plots from Gluscevic et al 2016a (not illustrations, and not the Appendix). 



1. Prep checklist:

-- create pmfs/code/results/ directory to store the plots; otherwise, change RESULTS_PATH in globals.py to where you want the plots to go.
-- if you want to create Fig 2, make sure you install healpix and healpy (see: https://github.com/healpy/healpy)
-- if you want to call pp.grid_DeltaL to make Figs 4 and 5, you must have numerical results somewhere (see README on how to produce those; they usually go to directories midFSTAR, hiFSTAR, and loFSTAR inside of results/, for default paths, and you can look at code/results to see the expected format) and pass those paths to appropriate functions in plots_pmfs.py (check the source code for documentation)
-- reion_functions.py must have file_21cmfast variable set to "â€¦__midFSTAR" 


2. Make plots from python command line:


import pylab as pl
pl.ion()
import plots_pmfs as pp

#Fig 2
pp.visualize_hp() 
# Fig 3
pp.arb_xT()
# Fig 4
pp.grid_DeltaL(modes=['xi'],ymax=1,folder='midFSTAR',folders_uncertainty=['loFSTAR','hiFSTAR'],ymin=0.05)
# Fig 5
pp.grid_DeltaL(modes=['B0', 'SI'],folder='midFSTAR')
# Fig 6
pp.sigma_z()
